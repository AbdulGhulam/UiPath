20 An empirical study of ﬁnancial institutions in the primary, secondary, and lending markets,
21 and of legal developments in this ﬁeld. The course examines the role of the various ﬁnancial
22 institutions in the ﬂow of funds through the ﬁnancial markets.
23 Regardless of the extent of your participation in class discussion, you must solve the end-of-
24 chapter problems to deepen your knowledge of the concepts covered in this class and to test
25 how well you have understood the material presented in the chapter. Learning this material
26 requires practice. Solving the problems is an essential step in the learning process. The types
27 of problems following each chapter are self-test problems, and mini-cases. The assignments
28 include problems of each type and also supplemental problems which I have prepared and
29 posted on Blackboard.

156 • Readings
157 Students should prepare for ALL regular scheduled classes prior to class meetings and
158 are responsible for all of the material discussed in class, assigned in the readings, and
159 problems assigned for homework regardless of your attendance status.
160 • Individual Assignments
161 Homework will be assigned on a weekly basis over Blackboard. Assignment will assigned
162 on Wednesdays and will be due by the following Monday at 3:00 PM (before the next
163 Monday class). Late submission will not be accepted.
164 • Group Assignments
165 Students need to form the group of 4-5 people. Students will need to come up with 4-5
166 questions to ask the guest speaker from Federal Reserve before the guest speaker visit.
167 After the guest speaker speech, each group at least need to raise one question and write a
168 group report about what you learned from the guest speaker. Details will be announced
169 later in the semester.
170 • Quizzes
171 Quizzes will be given through out the semester RANDOMLY without prior notiﬁcations.
172 Quizzes may be given at the beginning, middle, or end of the class and cover the materials
173 from the same date or from the previous class. Make-up quizzes will not be permitted
174 unless I am notiﬁed of your absence or lateness on a speciﬁc class date.
175 • Exams
176 Make-up exams will not be permitted unless I am notiﬁed of your absence on an exam
177 before the exam date. Make-up exams from excused absences will be scheduled at a
178 time mutually agreeable to the instructor and the student.
179 • Attendance Policy
180 Attendance is mandatory and expected. Students are expected to arrive on time and
181 stay in class until the class period ends. If you missed four or more class meetings, your
182 course grade, at the instructor’s discretion, will be reduced by one letter grade. If you
183 missed more than six classes (including exam dates), at the instructor’s discretion, the
184 grade will automatically become an F. If you are late for more than 20 minutes in a class
185 meeting, then it will be counted as “Late”. 2 “Late” will be counted as 1 absence.
186 • Class Communication
187 Major class announcements will be made through Blackboard with email notiﬁcations.
188 Online discussions can also be established on Blackboard. So please check the email on
189 your Blackboard account is correct.
190 • Small Tasks
191 In order to (1) bolster the student’s performance in courses in the business school and
192 (2) better prepare students for their professions and careers after school, faculty in CSB
193 set aside a small part of the total score in each course for small tasks/workshops. Each
194 4FINA 3335 Spring 2019
195 Financial Institutions and Markets Chih-Huei (Debby) Su, Ph.D., CFA
196 student is required to complete a minimum of three (three hours total) workshops. In
197 doing so, CSB will provide numerous workshops for all students taking CSB courses
198 (the complete list of workshops is available on Blackboard). As can be seen in the list,
199 the workshops are being oﬀered by diﬀerent academic support services on campus and
200 the workshops on computer applications are being oﬀered through an online provider
201 (
202 www.lynda.com
203 ).
204 – Workshops are being oﬀered during the activity period and in the evening on week-
205 days in the Fall/Spring semester.
206 – Workshops are also being oﬀered online via Lynda.com through the Houston Public
207 Library.
208 – While the students have to complete a minimum number of workshops per semester,
209 the same workshops could be used for various courses.
210 – Students need to attend a workshop lasting at least one hour to complete one ac-
211 tivity. For instance, if a student decides to take a half hour session in an on campus
212 workshop, she/he then needs to take an additional half hour session on something
213 else to complete one required activity.
214 • Student Conduct in a Learning Environment
215 Membership in the academic community places a special obligation on all members to
216 preserve an atmosphere conducive to the freedom to teach and to learn. Therefore, it is
217 the responsibility of each member of this class to maintain a positive learning environ-
218 ment in which the behavior of any individual does not disrupt the learning opportunities
219 for others. Students are expected to work, individually and together, to create an atmo-
220 sphere that is safe, valuing of one another, and open to diverse perspectives. Students
221 are expected to show courtesy, civility, and respect for one another and for the instructor.
222 The UST Student Handbook contains important information and expectations that all
223 students should know, including University policies and the Code of Student Conduct;
224 these documents are available at
225 www.stthom.edu/dos
226 .
227 It is the responsibility of the individual faculty member to determine, maintain, and
228 enforce the standards of behavior acceptable to preserving an atmosphere appropriate
229 for all teaching and learning activities in the course. Students will be warned if their
230 behavior is evaluated as not meeting the expected standards.
231 Sanctions for such behavior may include a range of responses from immediate removal
232 from class (or a student group meeting) to referral to the appropriate academic unit
233 and/or the Oﬃce of the Dean of Students for review of violations of behavioral standards.
234 Signiﬁcant and/or continued violations will result in administrative withdrawal from the
235 course.
236 11. Class Participation
237 The following criteria will be used to judge and grade your participation performance:
238 (a) Content Mastery:
239 The student makes evident by classroom comments and/or responses to questions, an
240 understanding of the facts, concepts, and theories presented in the assigned readings.
241 (b) Communication Skills:
242 The student informs other students in a clear and constructive manner what he/she
243 knows. Communication skills include listening to others and understanding what they
244 5FINA 3335 Spring 2019
245 Financial Institutions and Markets Chih-Huei (Debby) Su, Ph.D., CFA
246 have said, responding appropriately, asking clear, constructive questions, building on the
247 ideas of others, etc.
248 (c) Synthesis/Integration:
249 The student shows the connections between this material and other material. For ex-
250 ample, the student could take several ideas from the readings or class discussions and
251 combine them to produce a new perspective on an issue, or the student could take out-
252 side materials (personal experience, work experience, other classes etc.) and combine
253 them to create insights.
254 (d) Creativity:
255 The student shows further implications of the material by ﬁnding new ways of articu-
256 lating or setting the materials, which produce signiﬁcant insights, etc.
257 (e) Valuing:
258 The student identiﬁes values inherent to the material and oﬀer rationales based on some
259 value system.

300 The Cameron School of Business at the
301 University of St. Thomas
302 Mission Statement
303 Inspired by the Basilian Father’s motto of Goodness, Discipline and Knowledge, the Cameron
304 School of Business provides a comprehensive, high quality, ethically oriented business education to
305 a diverse student body enabling graduates to serve as leaders of faith and character in a global
306 economy.
307 Academic Honesty
308 Ethical conduct is essential to a community of scholars and students searching for truth. Any-
309 thing less than total commitment to honesty and honorable conduct undermines the eﬀorts of the
310 entire community. Academic integrity lies at the very heart of any institution of higher learning.
311 In the Cameron School of Business, students and faculty are expected to commit to a code that
312 exempliﬁes each individual’s honor and integrity. Any conduct that violates this standard and
313 betrays the respect of others is a matter of grave concern and, accordingly, is deemed unacceptable.
314 The tests/ exams will be individual eﬀorts. Student may work together on homework assignments,
315 but must submit their own assignments.
316 The penalty for an incident of academic dishonesty is, at the discretion of the professor, either a
317 mark of zero for the work in question or the grade of F for the course.
318 Accommodations
319 It is UST’s goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. Should you choose to
320 disclose a disability, contact your professor and Counseling and Disability Services (C&DS) so that
321 possible accommodations can be discussed. Accommodations are designed to minimize the impact
322 of a disability and ensure access to programs for all students with disabilities. C&DS can be reached
323 at P: 713/525-2169 or 6953, or at
324 c
325 ds@stthom.edu.
326 Any student with a disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me
327 (the professor) after class or during oﬃce hours. Additionally, students will need to contact Coun-
328 seling and Disability Services in Crooker Center. This oﬃce can be reached at P: 713/525-2169 or

333 professor) to discuss your needs. Additionally, you will need to register with the Counseling and
